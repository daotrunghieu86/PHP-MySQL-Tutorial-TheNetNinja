When you work with an application, you open it, do some changes, and then you close it. 
This is much like a Session. 
The computer knows who you are. 
It knows when you start the application and when you end. 
But on the internet there is one problem: the web server does not know who you are or what you do, because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.
